Deployed Link: https://brevenn.github.io/UTmodule.5.work-day-scheduler/

User Story:
AS A coding bootcamp student 
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner 
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

Usage: 
A calender application that allows the user to save information into time slots on a common buisness timeframe.
When the application loads the current time and date are displayed under the header. When the user clicks the
text boxes they are allowed to enter information into the slots. When the user clicks the save button, their 
information will be saved until removed. 


Acceptance Criteria:
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
